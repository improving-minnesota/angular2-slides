## Dependency Injection

* If a service is injected into a component it must first be provided
* A service can be provided to either a Component or a Module
* If a service is provided to a component, it is available to that component's children
* A service provided to a Module is available to the _entire application_
* Anytime you provide a service, it is instantiated
    * Be aware of this if sharing state in a service
