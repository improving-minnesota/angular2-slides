## Lab 7

- Create an `[atEmployee]` directive in `src/app/employee/employee-list/employee.directive.ts`
- This directive should take an `Employee` instance and output to the component's innerHTML the employee's name and whether an admin or not
- Note: `ElementRef` from `@angular/core` is helpful, as is the following snippet

```typescript
@Input()
set someValue() {
  // this is called each time someValue is updated
}
```
